# AutoHotKey Scripts
Collection of my personal Autohotkey scripts.
AutoHotKey can be found & Downloaded here: https://www.autohotkey.com/
Scripts are as is, use & customize as you wish. No support will be provided for scripts.

AutoHotKey must be installed to use .ahk files. If AutoHotKey is not installed .ahk files will not run, optionally if AHK is installed you can compile the .ahk files to .exe files.
